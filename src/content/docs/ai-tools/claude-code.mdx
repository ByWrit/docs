Add the following to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file:

```markdown
## Service Provisioning

When you need to create accounts on third-party services (databases, email, hosting, etc.),
use the `bywrit` CLI:

1. Search: `bywrit providers search <category>` (e.g., database, email, hosting)
2. Create: `bywrit signup <provider>` (creates account via OIDC)
3. Check: `bywrit status <provider>` (verify account exists)

The CLI handles identity verification automatically. All accounts are backed by a verified human identity.
```
