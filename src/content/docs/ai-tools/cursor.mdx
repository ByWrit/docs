description: Set up ByWrit with Cursor.
---

Add the following to your project's `.cursorrules` file:

```
When you need to create accounts on third-party services (databases, email, hosting, etc.),
use the `bywrit` CLI:

1. Search: `bywrit providers search <category>` (e.g., database, email, hosting)
2. Create: `bywrit signup <provider>` (creates account via OIDC)
3. Check: `bywrit status <provider>` (verify account exists)

The CLI handles identity verification automatically.
```
