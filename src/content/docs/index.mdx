import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## How it works

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="1. Verify once" icon="approve-check">
    Complete a one-time KYC check (government ID + selfie). Takes ~2 minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Generate a token" icon="random">
    Create an agent token from your dashboard and give it to your AI tool.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. AI signs up for you" icon="rocket">
    When your agent needs a service, it uses ByWrit to create an account backed by your verified identity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. You own everything" icon="open-book">
    Log in to any agent-created account manually. Full visibility and control.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## For Service Providers

Accept AI agent signups with confidence. ByWrit provides standard OIDC with KYC-verified identity — no new protocol to learn.
