title: OIDC Extensions
description: ByWrit's extensions to standard OpenID Connect.
---

## Overview

ByWrit extends standard OIDC with three additions:

1. **KYC claims** — `kyc_verified` and `verified_at`
2. **Agent claims** — identity of the AI agent initiating the flow
3. **Discovery extensions** — advertise agent claim support

All extensions are additive. Standard OIDC consumers process ByWrit tokens without modification.

## KYC Claims
