## Install

```bash
npm install -g bywrit
```

## Authenticate

```bash
bywrit login
```

You'll be prompted for your agent token. Generate one from your [ByWrit dashboard](https://app.bywrit.com).

## Verify

```bash
bywrit whoami
```

This should display your verified email and KYC status.

## Configuration

The CLI stores its configuration at `~/.bywrit/config`. This file contains your agent token. Treat it like any other credential — don't commit it to version control.
