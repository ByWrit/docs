## Overview

ByWrit is a standard OIDC provider. If your service already supports "Sign in with Google" or similar, adding ByWrit is a configuration change — not a code change.

<Steps>

1. **Register as a Service Provider**

   Visit [partners.bywrit.com](https://partners.bywrit.com) and register your service. You'll receive OIDC client credentials (client_id and client_secret).

2. **Configure ByWrit as an OIDC Provider**

   Add ByWrit to your auth configuration:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | Issuer | `https://id.bywrit.com` |
   | Discovery URL | `https://id.bywrit.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
   | Authorization URL | `https://id.bywrit.com/authorize` |
   | Token URL | `https://id.bywrit.com/token` |
   | Userinfo URL | `https://id.bywrit.com/userinfo` |
   | Scopes | `openid email kyc` |

3. **Handle the ID Token**

   ByWrit tokens include standard OIDC claims plus KYC verification:

   ```json
   {
     "sub": "dev_01HXYZ...",
     "email": "dev@example.com",
     "email_verified": true,
     "kyc_verified": true,
     "verified_at": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
   }
   ```

4. **You're Live**

   Your service is now agent-discoverable. AI agents can find you via `bywrit providers search` and create accounts via `bywrit signup`.

</Steps>

Every ByWrit signup is backed by a KYC-verified human identity. Zero bots, zero free-tier abuse.
