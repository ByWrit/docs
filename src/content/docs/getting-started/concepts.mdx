## What ByWrit Does

ByWrit is a thin identity assertion layer. It solves two problems:

1. **AI agents can't create accounts** — there's no way for a service to trust that a real human is behind an automated signup
2. **Service providers want verified users** — they need to know each account belongs to a real person, not a bot

ByWrit bridges this gap by verifying your identity once (via KYC) and then letting your AI agent use that verified identity to create accounts on integrated service providers.

## How It Works

### KYC-First Verification

When you sign up for ByWrit, you complete identity verification through Didit. This involves a government ID check and a selfie with liveness detection. Once verified, your identity is confirmed — one real human, one account.

### What ByWrit Stores

ByWrit practices radical data minimisation. After verification, we store exactly three things:

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Hash of your Didit user ID | Deduplication (one account per person) |
| Your verified email | Communication and OIDC claims |
| KYC status | Verified or failed |

That's it. No government ID images, no biometrics, no full name, no address. Didit handles the sensitive data — ByWrit only stores the assertion result.

### OIDC Provider

ByWrit acts as a standard OIDC (OpenID Connect) identity provider. When your AI agent creates an account on a service provider, it initiates an OIDC flow — the same mechanism behind "Sign in with Google" buttons. The service provider receives a token asserting your verified identity.

### Agent Tokens

An agent token is a credential you generate from your ByWrit dashboard and give to your AI coding tool. It allows the CLI to act on your behalf when provisioning services.

## Agent Claims (OIDC-A)

ByWrit tokens include optional agent identity claims when the flow is initiated by an AI agent:

- `agent_type` — coding, assistant, or autonomous
- `agent_model` — e.g., claude-opus-4-6
- `agent_provider` — e.g., anthropic
- `agent_instance_id` — unique session identifier

These claims give service providers visibility into which AI tools are creating accounts, enabling better analytics and risk assessment. Standard OIDC consumers that don't understand these claims simply ignore them.
