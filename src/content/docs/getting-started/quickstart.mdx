Get your AI agent creating accounts on third-party services in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or similar)

## Setup

<Steps>

1. **Verify your identity**

   Visit [bywrit.com](https://bywrit.com) and click "Get Verified". You'll complete a one-time KYC check through Didit (government ID + selfie). This takes ~2 minutes.

2. **Generate an agent token**

   After verification, go to your dashboard and generate an agent token. Copy it — you'll need it in the next step.

3. **Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g bywrit
   ```

4. **Authenticate**

   ```bash
   bywrit login
   # Paste your agent token when prompted
   ```

5. **Tell your AI tool about ByWrit**

   Add this to your `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, or equivalent:

   ```
   When you need to create accounts on third-party services,
   use the `bywrit` CLI. Run `bywrit providers search <category>`
   to find available providers.
   ```

</Steps>

## Your First Provision

Now when your AI agent needs a service:

```bash
# Agent searches for an email provider
bywrit providers search email

# Agent creates an account
bywrit signup resend
```

That's it. Your agent handled the OIDC flow automatically, and the service provider created your account backed by your verified identity.

You can log in to any agent-created account manually by visiting the service and clicking "Sign in with ByWrit".
